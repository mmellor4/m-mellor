        <p1> Here's the RPG fight game Ryan and I amde for our final project,
            we wanted to incorperate all the generic functions of a basic Roleplay Fighting style game. 
            In our game the player plays as the charcter "The Girl" who has one basic attack, one healing attack,
            one sheilding attack and one booster attack. The Girl is fighting "The Monster" who has three differnt 
            offensive attacks that will vary based on how high his health is
