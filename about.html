       <h1> About Me </h1>
        
        <p1>
            My name is Marie Mellor, I'm eighteen years old and a first year Computer Science major at 
            the University of Rhode Island 
            I'm from Lynnfield, Massachusetts but I'm adopted from China.
            I attended Austin Prepatory School fromt the seventh to the twelfth grade
            When I was sixteen for an independant study technology classs
            I created and iPhone app that allowed the user to track gymnastics meet scores.
            I chose that as my project since I had never found a gymnastics score tracking app that worked well and
            decided why not make my own.
            Unfortunately I forgot to renew the application license so it is not currently availible for download.
            I really enjoy reading, writing, filmmaking and being outside. 
            Back home, I live with my parents, my not-so-little sister and two dogs Boomer and Brownie.
            I hope to learn more here at my time at URI and am excited to discover new things in CSC106. <br>
            
            I've been competattive gymnast almost all my life and hope to continue on doing gymnastics at 
            URI on their club team. Gymnastics has always been a big part of my life and I couldn't imagine not 
            being able to do it. 
            In high school I participated in my school's digital media club known as "APS Media" as well 
            as the school paper "The Legend"
            In APS Media, we the students created short films and skits using the film equipment from the school to
            create fun videos for the school as well as running the news show "Austin in Focus" and 
            the SNL parody show "Thursday Morning Live*". Being apart of those clubs in high school really made me love working
            with technology more and more aswell as getting me interested in things like writing and filmmaking.
