       <h1> About Me </h1>
        
        <p1>
            My name is Marie Mellor, I'm eighteen years old and a first year Computer Science major at 
            the University of Rhode Island 
            I'm from Lynnfield, Massachusetts but I'm adopted from China.
            I've been competattive gymnast almost all my life and hope to continue on doing gymnastics at 
            URI on their club team.
            When I was sixteen for an independant study technology classs
            I created and iPhone app that allowed the user to track gymnastics meet scores.
            I chose that as my project since I had never found a gymnastics score tracking app that worked well and decided why not make my own.
            Unfortunately I forgot to renew the application license so it is not currently availible for download.
            I really enjoy reading, writing, filmmaking and being outside. I have two dogs back home named Boomer and Brownie.
            I hope to learn more here at my time at URI and am excited to discover new things in CSC106.
